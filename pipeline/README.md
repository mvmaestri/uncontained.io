# pipeline

This is a pipeline developed in Tekton, the peaceful cat üêà. It contains the main steps of a continuous software delivery process and it enforces a strict semantic version validation strategy, managing tag increments automatically for you.

The build strategy is based on [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah), which is a tool that facilitates building OCI container images.

Furthermore, this package automatically manages three independent environments, which can be customized as needed.
The 3 different environments are:

- uncontained-cicd
- uncontained-development
- uncontained-production

All the components corresponding to each environment were carefully introduced and are following the least privilege principle.

## Integrations

The integration with the Github repository is done through a token and with a secure password-less RSA key-pair to add new commits and tags. You will need to provide a valid, compatible, private key that is available to your Github account.

Besides that, it was designed to be plug and play. Upon installation, the webhook will be created automatically for you and all other data must come from the payload received through a new commit in your repository.

It also allows changing the status of each commit to pending or success depending on the result of the pipeline tasks. Developers can view the status of each commit in the Github interface.

## Deployments

The pipeline manages the creation of deployments for each environment and also takes care of enforcing standards such as code linting, chart linting, unit testing, code audit, and code coverage.

Images streams, deployments, services, and routes are created automatically through the pipeline, if necessary, at each new commit. This provides a repeatable way for software delivery and makes life easier for users who consume the application, whether for development or for other purposes.

All deployments are managed through `git push` by following a strict implementation of gitflow.
Currently supporting for the following branches, environment and and routes.

| Branch type | Upgrade | Docs | Dev | Prod | Hostname
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| `develop` |  | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ï | develop-uncontained-development.apps.host.com | 
| `feature/login` |  | ‚≠ï | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ï | feature-login-uncontained-development.apps.d1.casl.rht-labs.com | 
| `release/1.0.0` | minor* | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ï | ‚úÖ | v1-0-0-uncontained-production.apps.d1.casl.rht-labs.com | 
| `hotfix/1.0.1` | patch | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ï | ‚úÖ | v1-0-1-uncontained-production.apps.d1.casl.rht-labs.com | 
| `patch/1.0.2` | patch | ‚úÖ | ‚≠ï | ‚úÖ | v1-0-2-uncontained-production.apps.d1.casl.rht-labs.com | 

*Obs: The first version `0.0.0` exceptionally will use a major upgrade to `1.0.0`.

A documentation based endpoint will be also exposed for each environment through the routes hostnames:

- documentation-uncontained-development.apps.d1.casl.rht-labs.com
- documentation-uncontained-production.apps.d1.casl.rht-labs.com



## Installing

In this step by step we will assume the following values:

| Namespace | Value |
| --- | --- |
| CI-CD | uncontained-ci-cd |
| Development | uncontained-development |
| Production | uncontained-production |

If a ci-cd environment already exists, you can use it without the need to create a different one.

For the other two environments you have to ensure that they exist. If they do not exist, you can create following the example below;

    oc create namespace uncontained-ci-cd
    oc create namespace uncontained-development
    oc create namespace uncontained-production

## Configuration

To configure your own application and send it through the pipeline you must update the `values.yaml` file to reflect a repository to which you have access. Please use a repository name with a lowercase format.

It will be in this repository that the webhook will be automatically created and will trigger, on each new commit, a new PipelineRun on Tekton. You can create a new token on Github by [clicking here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), make sure to tick the `admin:repo_hook`, `repo` and `user` permissions.

### Secrets 

The Github token will only be shown once, be sure to save it somewhere safe. 
Then copy the token and replace it in the command below.

    oc create secret generic github-webhook-secret --from-literal=token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -n uncontained-ci-cd

In order to avoid using passwords to publish new content on Github, we will use a keypair. 
[Here's](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) how to create one if you don't already have one available on your machine.

Assuming your private key was created in the default location `$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`, you can run the command below to create a generic secret.

    oc create secret generic uncontained-github-deploy-secret \
        --from-file=ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa \
        --namespace uncontained-ci-cd

### Applying

Great. Now that the secrets have been set up correctly we can install the package. For this, we will use helm, as below.

    helm template -f pipeline/values.yaml pipeline | oc apply -f-

How to verify that the installation was successful:

- See if you github webhook integration was created. Go to your github repository, click on Settings, and then on Webhooks.

You can check the webhook creation logs by searching for `webhook` in your pods in the `uncontained-ci-cd` namespace. If something has failed, you can delete TaskRun `create-uncontained-github-webhook`, update your webhook data from `values.yaml` and run the **Applying** step again.


cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: 11009103-tekton-pipeline-pull-secret
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <token here>
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
EOF


### Policies

Before publishing a new commit, we will need to define some permissions for the pipeline ServiceAccount. This will allow the pipeline to move images from one environment to another.

```
oc policy add-role-to-user \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa \
    --namespace=uncontained-development
```

```
oc policy add-role-to-user \
    system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa \
    --namespace=uncontained-production
```

And also for triggers ServiceAccount:

    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa -n uncontained-ci-cd
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa -n uncontained-development
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa -n uncontained-production
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa -n uncontained-ci-cd
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa -n uncontained-development
    oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:uncontained-ci-cd:uncontained-tekton-triggers-sa -n uncontained-production
